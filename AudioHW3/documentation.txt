Audio Visualizer - TypeScript Refactor - HW3


TypeScript Implementation
- Changed all .js files to .ts extensions
- Added primitive type annotations such as string, number and void
- Updated import statements to work with TypeScript
- Added appropriate type definitions throughout the code
- HTML elements were typed out using "as HTML____Element"
- Interface folder created for draw-params


Challenges
- Refactoring HTML IDs to match kebab-case while syncing them with TypeScript references.
- In converting to typescript I ran into some issues between classes due to poor organization and naming. 


Improvements Made
- Stronger structure with clear separation of logic.
- Renamed element IDs and file names to match naming standard
- Code is now in a single file: `bundle.js`. This is compatible with both local and server deployment
